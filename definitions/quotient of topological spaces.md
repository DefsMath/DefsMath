The quotient of a [[topological space]] $X$ by a [[subspace topology|subspace]] $Y\subseteq X$ is the [[quotient by equivalence relation|quotient by]] the [[equivalence relation]] $\sim$ given by $y\sim y'$ if $y$ and $y'\in Y$. 

Let $q: X\to X/Y$ be given by $x\mapsto [x]$. This function is (well-defined and) [[surjective]]. The [[topological space|topology]] on the quotient $X/Y$ is the collection of $U\subset X/Y$ such that the [[inverse image]] $q^{-1}(U)$ is [[open]] in $X$.
