An element [[algebraic element of an algebra|algebraic]] over the [[field]] $F$ can be **solved for by radicals** if it is an element of a [[field]] $K$ which can be obtained as a succession of [[simple group|simple]] [[field extension|extensions]] adjoining $n$th roots of elements of $F$. A [[polynomial ring|polynomial]] $f(x) \in F[x]$ can be **solved by radicals** if all of its roots can be solved *for* by radicals.
