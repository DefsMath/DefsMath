Let $f:A\to \mathbb C$ be a function [[holomorphic]] on the [[annulus]] $A$. Then $f(z)$ can be written as the **Laurent series** $$f(z) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty a_n (z-c)^n$$ for $a_n,c\in \mathbb C$ and $a_n$ given by $$a_n = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_\gamma \frac{f(z)}{(z-c)^{n+1}}\text dz$$ for $\gamma$ a positively-oriented piecewise [[class|continuously differentiable]] [[loop]] in $A$.
