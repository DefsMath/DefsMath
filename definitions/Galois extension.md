A [[field extension]] $E/F$ is **Galois** if it is [[algebraic extension|algebraic]], [[normal extension|normal]], and [[separable field|separable]]. The [[group]] of [[automorphism group|automorphisms]] of $E$ that fix $F$, denoted $\text{Gal}(E/F)$, is called the **Galois group** of $E$ over $F$. 

Note: in MATH 25900, base fields are usually assumed to be [[perfect field|perfect]], and because an [[algebraic extension of perfect field is separable]], we only need the [[normal extension|normality]] and [[algebraic extension|algebraic]] conditions.

Equivalently, $E$ is **Galois** over $F$ if the [[order of a group|order]] of the [[set of automorphisms fixing a subfield is a subgroup|automorphism group]] $\text{Aut}(E/F)$ is equal to the [[degree of field extension|degree]] of $E$ over $F$.
