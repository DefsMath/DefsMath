The **degree** of a [[field extension]] $F \subset E$ is the [[dimension of vector space|dimension]] of $E$ when considered as a [[vector space]] over $F$. If $E$ is [[simple field extension]] [[generate a field|generated]] by $\alpha$, then the degree is also [[isomorphism of simple field and quotient by minimal polynomial|equal to]] the [[degree of polynomial|degree]] of the [[algebraic element of an algebra|minimal polynomial]] in $E[x]$ of $\alpha$ over $F$.
