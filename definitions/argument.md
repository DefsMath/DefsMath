Let $z\in \mathbb C$ be a [[complex numbers|complex number]]. Then the **argument** of $z$, denoted $\text{arg}(z)$, is the angle between the vector in $\mathbb R^2$ corresponding to $z$ and the positive real axis. Equivalently, it is any real number $\theta$ such that $z= r(\cos\theta+i\sin\theta) = re^{i\theta}$, via [[Euler's formula]].
