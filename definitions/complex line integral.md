Let $U$ be an [[open]] subset of $\mathbb C$ and $f:U \to  \mathbb C$ a [[continuous]] function and $\gamma:[a,b]\to U$ a piecewise [[class|continuously]] [[differentiable]] [[path]] contained in $U$. The **complex line integral** of $f$ over $\gamma$ is the [[complex integral]] $$\int_\gamma f(z)\text dz = \int_a^b f(\gamma(t))\gamma'(t)\text dt$$
