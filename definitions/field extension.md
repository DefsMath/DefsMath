A [[field]] $E$ is a **field extension** of the [[field]] $F$ if $F$ is a [[subfield]] of $E$. 

The field extension may be considered as a [[vector space]] over $F$. The [[dimension of vector space|dimension]] of $E$ as an $F$-[[vector space]] is denoted $[E:F]$, $\deg(E/F)$, or $\deg_F(E)$.

The most basic field extension comes from adjoining an element $\Theta$ to $F$. It is denoted $F(\Theta)$, and it is the smallest [[field]] containing both $F$ and $\Theta$.
