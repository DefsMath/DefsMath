A **simplicial complex** is a [[âˆ†-complex]] whose [[n-simplex|simplices]] are uniquely determined by their vertices. That is, each [[n-simplex]] has $n+1$ distinct vertices and no other [[n-simplex]] has this same set of vertices.

Alternatively (and equivalently), a (geometric) **simplicial complex** $X$ (i.e. one embedded in [[dimension of vector space|Euclidean space]] $\mathbb R^N$) is a collection of [[n-simplex|simplices]] of various dimensions such that 
1. Each [[face of an n-simplex|face]] of each [[n-simplex|simplex]] in $X$ is an element of $X$ and
2. Elements of $X$ intersect only at their [[face of an n-simplex|faces]]. This condition represents a kind of "gluing" together of simplices along faces.

An **abstract simplicial complex** is a collection of vertices $X^0$ together with, for each $k\in \mathbb N$, a set $X^k$ of subsets of $X^0$ (i.e. each $X^k$ is  a subset of the [[power set]] of $X^0$) such that each element of $X^k$ is a set with [[cardinal number|cardinality]] $k+1$ and such that any subset of an element of $X^k$ of size $\ell + 1$ is an element of $X^\ell$.
