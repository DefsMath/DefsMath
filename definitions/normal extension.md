Let $E$ be an [[algebraic extension]] of the [[field]] $F$ and let $\Omega$ be an [[algebraically closed]] [[field]] containing $F$. Then $E$ is a **normal extension** of $F$ if it satisfies any of the following three equivalent conditions:
1. For each $\alpha\in E$, $E$ contains a [[splitting field]] of the [[algebraic element of an algebra|minimal polynomial]] of $\alpha$ over $F$.
2. $\{\alpha\in E\mid E \text{ contains a splitting field of the minimal polynomial of } \alpha \text{ over } F\}$ [[generate a field|generates]] $E$ as a [[field extension]] of $F$.
3. For every $F$-[[field embedding|embedding]] $\phi:E\to \Omega$, we have $\phi(E) \subset E$. 

It is trivial that statement (1) implies (2). To see that (2) implies (3), let $S$ be the set from the statement of (2). Then for $\alpha\in S$, $E$ contains a [[splitting field]] of the [[algebraic element of an algebra|minimal polynomial]] of $\alpha$. Call that [[field]] $K$. We know that there [[existence of embedding from algebraic extension to algebraically closed field|exists]] an $F$-[[field embedding|embedding]] $\phi:E\to \Omega$. Then $\phi(E) \supset\phi(K)$, so $\phi(\alpha)\in E$. It follows that $E$, being [[generate a field|generated]] by $S$ over $F$, is mapped by $\phi$ into itself. To see that (3) implies (1), Let $\alpha\in E$ and let $\beta\in \Omega$ be any root of the [[algebraic element of an algebra|minimal polynomial]] of $\alpha$. Then there [[existence of embedding from algebraic extension to algebraically closed field that permutes roots of minimal polynomial in extension|exists]] an $F$-[[field embedding|embedding]] $\phi:E\to \Omega$ such that $\phi(\alpha) = \beta$, but by hypothesis $\phi(E) \subset E$, so $\beta\in E$. It follows that all [[root|roots]] of the [[algebraic element of an algebra|minimal polynomial]] of $\alpha$ over $F$ are contained in $E$, which is $(1)$. 

Equivalently, $E$ is a **normal extension** of $F$ if it is the [[splitting field]] of a *collection* of [[polynomial ring|polynomials]] in $F[x]$.
