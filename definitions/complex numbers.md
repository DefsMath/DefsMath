The **complex numbers** are given by ordered pairs of [[real numbers]]: $$\mathbb C = \{(a,b)\mid a,b\in \mathbb R\}$$ and endowed with two [[binary operation|binary operations]]: multiplication and addition. 

Addition is defined pairwise, while multiplication is defined as $$(a,b)*(c,d) = (ac-bd,bc+ad)$$ for all $(a,b),(c,d) \in \mathbb C$. 

We often write $a+bi$ for $(a,b)$ where $i^2=-1$.
