Fix $\{V_i\}_{i\in \mathbb N}$ a (possibly infinite) sequence of finite-[dimensional](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/dimension_of_vector_space) [vector spaces](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/vector_space) over a [field](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/field) $k$. Then we can define $$V = \bigoplus_{i\geq 0}V_i = \{(v_{i_1},\dots, v_{i_N}) \mid N\in \mathbb N, v_{i_k} \in V_{i_k}\}.$$ If we consider each $V_i$ as a [linearly independent](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/linearly_independent) [subspace](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/subspace_topology) of $V$, we can consider the tuples as finite sums of vectors. Such a $V$ is a **graded vector space**.
