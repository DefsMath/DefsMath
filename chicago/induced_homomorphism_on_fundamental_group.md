Let $p:X\to Y$ be a [continuous](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/continuous) map between [topological spaces](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/topological_space). Define $p_*:\pi_1(X,x) \to \pi_1(Y,p(x))$ to be the map between the [fundamental groups](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/fundamental_group) of $X$ at $x$ and $Y$ at $p(x)$ given by $p_*[f] = [p\circ f]$. This map is a [homomorphism](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/group_homomorphism) as $p_*[f\cdot g] = [p\circ (f\cdot g)] = p_*[f]p_*[g]$.
