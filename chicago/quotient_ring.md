Let $R$ be a [ring](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/ring) and $I$ an [ideal](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/ring_ideal) in $R$. Define an [equivalence relation](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/equivalence_relation) $\sim$ on $R$ by $a\sim b$ when $a-b \in I$. The [equivalence classes](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/equivalence_class) are given by $[a] = a+ I = \{a+r \mid r\in I\}$. The set of all such equivalence classes is denoted $R/I$, or the **quotient of $R$ by $I$**.  The operations addition ($(a+I)+ (b+I) = (a+b)+I$) and multiplication ($(a+I)(b+I) = (ab)+I$) are [well-defined](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/well-defined). write_proof 

Moreover, this itself is a [ring](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/ring) write_proof.

The quotient comes with a [surjective](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/surjective) [homomorphism](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/ring_homomorphism) $R\to R/I$ given by $r\mapsto r+I$.
