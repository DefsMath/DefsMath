Let $(X,\Sigma, \mu)$ be a [measure space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/measure_space). The [measure](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/measure_space) $\mu$ is **σ-finite** if it satisfies one of the following equivalent criteria:
- $X$ can be covered with at most countably many (pairwise disjoint, this is not required) [measurable](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/measurable) sets of finite [measure](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/##############measure);
- $X$ can be covered with a monotone sequence of [measurable](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/measurable) sets of finite [measure](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/##############measure);
- There exists a positive [measurable function](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/measurable_function) $f$ whose [integral](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/Lebesgue_integral) is finite.
