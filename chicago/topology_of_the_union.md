Let $X$ and $Y$ be [topological spaces](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/topological_space). The [topology](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/##################topology) on their disjoint union $X\amalg Y$ has as [open](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/open) sets the (disjoint) unions of sets that are [open](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/open) in $X$ and $Y$.
