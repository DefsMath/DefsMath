An element [algebraic](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/algebraic_element_of_an_algebra) over the [field](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/field) $F$ can be **solved for by radicals** if it is an element of a [field](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/field) $K$ which can be obtained as a succession of [simple](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/simple_group) [extensions](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/field_extension) adjoining $n$th roots of elements of $F$. A [polynomial](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/polynomial_ring) $f(x) \in F[x]$ can be **solved by radicals** if all of its roots can be solved *for* by radicals.
