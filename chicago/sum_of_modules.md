Let $R$ be a [ring](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/ring) and let $M$ be an $R$-[module](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/module_over_a_ring). For $A$ and $B$ [submodules](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/submodule) of $M$, define the **sum** of $A$ and $B$ by $$A+B = \{a+b\mid a\in A,b\in B\}.$$ It is itself a [submodule](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/submodule) of $M$, and in particular is the smallest one containing both $A$ and $B$.
