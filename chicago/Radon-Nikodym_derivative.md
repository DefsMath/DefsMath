Let $(X,\Sigma)$ be a [measurable space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/measurable) with [measures](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/measure_space) $\mu$ and $\nu$ such that $\nu$ is [absolutely continuous](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/absolute_continuity_of_measure) with respect to $\mu$. The **Radon-Nikodym derivative** $\frac{\text d\nu}{\text d\mu}$ is the function $f \in$ [L](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/Lp_space)$_1(\mu)$ such that $\nu(A) = \int_A f\text d\mu$.
