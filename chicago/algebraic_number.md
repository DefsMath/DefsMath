An **algebraic number** is a number that is a root of a nonzero [polynomial](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/polynomial_ring) in one variable over $\mathbb Q$. It is often denoted by $\overline{\mathbb Q}$. 

[The algebraic numbers form a field](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/algebraic_numbers_form_a_field).
