The **cyclotomic field of $n$th [roots of unity](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/root_of_unity)** is [generated](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/generate_a_field) over $\mathbb Q$ by a [primitive root of unity](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/primitive_root_of_unity) $n$th root of unity: $\mathbb Q(\zeta_n)$.
