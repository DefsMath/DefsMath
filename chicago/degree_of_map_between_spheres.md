Let $f:S^n\to S^n$ be a function. The [induced homomorphism](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/continuous_functions_induce_homomorphisms_on_homology_groups) $f_*: \tilde H_n(S^n)\to \tilde H_n(S^n)$ [is](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/reduced_homology_of_the_sphere) a [homomorphism](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/group_homomorphism) from an infinite [cyclic group](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/cyclic_group) to itself. [Thus it must be](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/classification_of_group_homomorphisms_Z_to_G) of the form $f_*(\alpha) = d\alpha$ for some integer $d$ depending only on $f$. The integer $d$ is the **degree** of $f$.
