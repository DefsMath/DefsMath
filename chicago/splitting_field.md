Let $F$ be a [field](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/field) and let $f$ be a [monic](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/monic) [polynomial](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/polynomial_ring) with coefficients in $F$. Then a [field extension](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/field_extension) $F\subset E$ is a **splitting field** if there exist $\{a_i\}_{i=1}^d$ such that $$f(t) = \prod_{i=1}^d (t-a_i) \in E[t]$$ and moreover $E$ is [generated](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/generate_a_field) by these $a_i$, i.e. $E= F(a_1,\dots, a_d)$.
