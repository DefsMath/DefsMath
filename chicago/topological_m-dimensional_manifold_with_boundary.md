A **topological $m$-dimensional manifold with boundary** is a [topological space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/topological_space) $M$ such that 
1. for all $p \in M$, there exists an [open](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/open) neighborhood $U$ of $p$ [homeomorphic](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/homeomorphism) to an [open](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/open) set in the [closed half-space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/closed_half-space) $H^m$; 
2. $M$ is [Hausdorff](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/Hausdorff);
3. $M$ is [second-countable](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/second-countable).
