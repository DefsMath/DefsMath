A function $f:\mathbb U\to \mathbb C$ is **analytic** on the [open](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/open) set $U\subset\mathbb C$ if for any $z_0\in U$, $f(z)$ may be written as a [power series](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/power_series)$$f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n(z-z_0)^n$$ with $a_n \in \mathbb C$ for all $n$ and the [series converges](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/series_convergence) to $f(z)$ in a neighborhood of $z_0$.
