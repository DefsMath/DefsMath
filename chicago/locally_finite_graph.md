A [graph](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/graph) $X$ is **locally finite** if each vertex is a [boundary](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/boundary) point of only finitely many eges or if $X$ is a [locally compact](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/locally_compact) [topological space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/topological_space).
