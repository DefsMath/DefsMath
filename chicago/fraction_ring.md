Let $R$ be a [commutative](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/commutative) [ring](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/ring) and let $S$ be a subset of $R$ that is closed under multiplication and contains the multiplicative [identity](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/identity_element). Then $$S^{-1}R = \left\{\left[\frac{r}{s}\right]\mid r\in R,s\in S\right\}$$  where equivalence of fractions is given by $\left[\frac{r_1}{s_1}\right] =\left[\frac{r_2}{s_2}\right]$ if and only if there exists $k \in S$ such that $kr_1s_2 = kr_2s_1$.
 
This is itself a [ring](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/ring) under the usual operations we know and love for fractions of integers. 
 
If $S$ is exactly the nonzero elements of $R$, then this forms a [field](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/field).
