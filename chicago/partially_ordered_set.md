A **partially ordered set** is a set $X$ together with a [homogeneous relation](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/homogeneous_relation) $\leq$ such that for all $x,y,z\in X$,
1. $\leq$ is [reflexive](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/reflexive), i.e. $x\leq x$;
2. $\leq$ is [antisymmetric](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/antisymmetric), i.e. if $x\leq y$ and $y\leq x$ then $x=y$;
3. $\leq$ is [transitive](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/transitive), i.e. if $x\leq y$ and $y\leq z$ then $x\leq z$.
