**Euler's totient function**, written $\phi(n)$, is a function $\mathbb N\to\mathbb N$ that gives the number of integers less than $n$ that are [coprime](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/coprime) to $n$. That is, the number of integers less than $n$ whose [greatest common divisor](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/greatest_common_divisor) with $n$ is 1.
