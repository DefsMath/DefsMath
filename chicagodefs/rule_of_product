If there are $a$ ways of doing one thing and $b$ ways of doing another thing, then there are $ab$ ways of doing both things.  This can be extended [inductively](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/induction).

Set theoretically, this is the definition of the product of [cardinal numbers](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/cardinal_numbers): $$|S_1|\cdot|S_2|\cdots|S_n| = |S_1\times S_2\times\cdots S_n|$$ where $|\cdot|$ is the [cardinal number](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/cardinal_number) of the sets $S_i$ and $\times$ is the [Cartesian product](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/Cartesian_product) of sets. The sets need not be finite nor does the number of sets.
