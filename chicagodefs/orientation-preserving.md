Let $U, V \subset\mathbb R^n$ be [open](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/open) and let $f:U\to V$ be a $C^k$ [diffeomorphism](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/diffeomorphism). Then $f$ is **orientation-preserving** if the [determinant](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/determinant) of its [total derivative](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/differentiable) is always positive: $$\text{det}(Df(x)) > 0$$ for all $x \in U$.
