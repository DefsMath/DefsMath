The **Baire classes** of [continuous](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/continuous) real-valued functions on a [topological space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/topological_space) $X$ are defined as follows:
- [continuous](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/continuous) functions are Baire-0;
- functions that are the [pointwise limit](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/pointwise_convergence) of a sequence of [continuous](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/continuous) functions are Baire-1;
- for all $\alpha \in \mathbb N$, functions that are the [pointwise limit](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/######################pointwise_limit) of a sequence functions of Baire class less than $\alpha$ are Baire-$\alpha$.
