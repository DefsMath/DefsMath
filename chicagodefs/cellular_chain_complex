---Let $X$ be a [CW complex](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/bijective). Then by [These](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/CW_complex) [three](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/relative_homology_of_n-skeletons_of_CW_complexes) [results](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/kth_homology_group_of_n-skeleton_is_zero_when_k_>_n), we can write parts of the [long exact sequences](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/inclusion_of_n-skeleton_in_CW_complex_induces_isomorphism_between_kth_homology_groups_for_k_<_n) of the [pairs](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/long_exact_sequence_of_a_pair) $(X^{n+1}, X^n)$, $(X^n, X^{n-1})$, and $(X^{n-1}, X^{n-2})$ of the $n$-skeleta of $X$ can be written in the [commutative diagram](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/exact_sequence_on_reduced_homology_of_space_and_retractable_subspace) of the [homology groups](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/commutative_diagram) and [relative homology groups](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/homology_group) ![Screen Shot 2021-12-02 at 11.12.04 AM.png](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/relative_homology_groups) where $d_{n+1}$ and $d_n$ are the compositions $j_n\partial_{n+1}$ and $j_{n-1}\partial_n$, which in turn are "relativizations" of the [boundary maps](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/boundary_homomorphism) $\partial_n$ and $\partial_{n+1}$. 

The composition $d_nd_{n+1}$ is zero because the [composition of consecutive boundary homomorphisms is 0](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/composition_of_consecutive_boundary_homomorphisms_is_0). The horizontal part of this diagram is therefore a [chain complex](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/chain_complex) called the **cellular chain complex** of $X$. 

Because $H_n(X^n, X^{n-1})$ is [free](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/free_group) with [basis](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/basis_for_abelian_group) in [bijection](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/bijective) with $n$-cells of $X$, we can think of its elements as linear combinations of $n$-cells of $X$.
