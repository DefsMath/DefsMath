Let $X$ be a set. The **symmetric group** $S_X$ is the set of all [bijections](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/bijective) from $X$ to itself.

When $X$ is finite with [cardinal number](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/cardinal_number) $n$, it is denoted $S_n$ and consists of the set of permutations on $n$ letters.
