Let $f$ be in the [Schwartz space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/Schwartz_space) of the [p-adic field](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/p-adic_field) $\mathbb Q_p$. That is, let $f\in C_c^\infty(\mathbb Q_p)$. Then the analogue to the **[Fourier transform](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/Fourier_transform)** of $f$ is given by $$\widehat{f}(u) = \int_{\mathbb Q_p}f(x)\psi_u(x)\text dx$$ where $\psi_u$ is the multiple of the [Basic Additive Character](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/Basic_Additive_Character) on $\mathbb Q_p$ and the [integral](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/Lebesgue_integral) is taken with respect to the [Haar measure](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/Haar_measure_on_additive_Qp) on $\mathbb Q_p$.
