A **covering space** of a [topological space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/topological_space) $X$ is another [topological space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/topological_space) $\tilde X$ together with a [continuous](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/continuous) map $p:\tilde X\to X$ such that there exists an [open](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/open) cover $\{U_\alpha\}$ of of $X$ such that for all $\alpha$, the [inverse image](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/inverse_image) $p^{-1}(U_\alpha)$ is a disjoint union of [open](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/open) sets in $\tilde X$, each of which is mapped [homeomorphically](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/homeomorphism) [onto](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/surjective) $U_\alpha$. Note that $p^{-1}(U_\alpha)$ does not need to be nonempty. Thus $p$ need not be [surjective](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/surjective).

Alternatively, let $E$ and $B$ be [locally path-connected](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/locally_path-connected) [topological spaces](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/topological_space). A [continuous](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/continuous) function $p:E\to B$ is a **covering space** (of $B$?) if it is [surjective](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/surjective) and if each point $p\in B$ has an [open](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/open) [neighborhood](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/neighborhood) $V$ such that each [connected component](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/connected_component) of the [inverse image](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/inverse_image) $p^{-1}(V)$ is [open](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/open) in $E$ and is mapped [homeomorphically](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/##############homeomorphically) onto $V$ by $p$. A [path-connected](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/path-connected) [open](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/open) subset $V$ with this property is a **fundamental neighborhood** of $B$. The space $E$ is called the **total space** and the space $B$ is called the **base space**.  Write the [fiber](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/fiber) of the point $b$ as $F_b = p^{-1}(b)$.
