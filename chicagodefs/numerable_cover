 title: numerable cover
 permalink: /numerable_cover
---An [open cover](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/open_cover) $\{U\}$ of a [topological space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/topological_space) $B$ is **numerable** if for each $U$ there exist [continuous](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/continuous) maps $\lambda_U:B\to I$ (where $I$ is the unit [interval](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/interval)) such that the [inverse image](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/inverse_image) $\lambda_U^{-1}((0,1]) = U$ and if the cover is [locally finite](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/locally_finite_cover).

todo this seems to have a double word
