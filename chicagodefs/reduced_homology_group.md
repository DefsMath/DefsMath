Let $X$ be a [topological space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/topological_space). The $n$th **reduced homology group** of $X$, denoted $\tilde H_n(X)$, is the $n$th [homology group](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/homology_group) of the [chain complex](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/chain_complex) $$\cdots \to C_2(X) \to C_1(x) \to C_0(X) \to \mathbb Z\to 0$$ where the maps between the [groups](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/group) $C_i$ of [n-chains](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/n-chain) are the usual [boundary homomorphisms](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/boundary_homomorphism) and the map (call it $\varepsilon$) $C_0(X)\to \mathbb Z$ is given by $$\varepsilon\left(\sum_i n_i\sigma_i\right) = \sum_i n_i.$$

Reduced homology groups are introduced so that a [point has trivial homology group](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/singular_homology_of_a_point) for all values of $n$ including zero.
