Let $A$ and $B$ be [subspaces](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/subspace_topology) of the [topological space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/topological_space) $X$ such that $X$ is the union of the [interiors](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/interior) of $A$ and $B$. A **Mayer-Vietoris sequence** is an [exact sequence](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/exact_sequence) of the form $$\cdots\to H_n(A\cap B)\to H_n(A)\oplus H_n(B) \to H_n(X) \to H_{n-1}(A\cap B) \to\cdots$$$$\to H_0(X) \to 0.$$The arrows between $H_n(A\cap B)$ and $H_n(A)\oplus H_n(B)$ are generally labeled $\Phi$, the arrows between $H_n(A)\oplus H_n(B)$ and $H_n(X)$ are generally labeled $\Psi$, and the arrows between degrees (the [boundary homomorphisms](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/boundary_homomorphism)) are as usual denoted $\partial$.
