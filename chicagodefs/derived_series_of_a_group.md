The **derived series** of a [group](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/group) $G$ is the descending series of consecutive [derived subgroups](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/commutator_subgroup) of $G$: $$G = G^{(0)} \supseteq G^{(1)} = [G,G] \supseteq \cdots \supseteq G^{(i)}\supseteq \cdots$$ where $G^{(i+1)} = [G^{(i)},G^{(i)}]$. Note that this series may not reach the trivial subgroup.
