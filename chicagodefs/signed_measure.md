A **signed measure** on the [measurable space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/measurable) $(X,\Sigma)$ is a function $$\mu: \Sigma \to \mathbb R \cup \{-\infty\} \text{ or } \mathbb R \cup \{\infty\}$$ such that $\mu(\emptyset) =0$ and $\mu$ is [σ-additive](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/σ-additive). Note that $\mu$ cannot take on both $-\infty$ and $\infty$ as values.
