---A **simplicial complex** is a [∆-complex](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/∆-complex) whose [simplices](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/n-simplex) are uniquely determined by their vertices. That is, each [n-simplex](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/n-simplex) has $n+1$ distinct vertices and no other [n-simplex](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/n-simplex) has this same set of vertices.

Alternatively (and equivalently), a (geometric) **simplicial complex** $X$ (i.e. one embedded in [Euclidean space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/dimension_of_vector_space) $\mathbb R^N$) is a collection of [simplices](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/##########simplices) of various dimensions such that 
1. Each [face of an face](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/face_of_an_##########face) of each [simplex](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/##########simplex) in $X$ is an element of $X$ and
2. Elements of $X$ intersect only at their [face of an faces](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/face_of_an_##########faces). This condition represents a kind of "gluing" together of simplices along faces.

An **abstract simplicial complex** is a collection of vertices $X^0$ together with, for each $k\in \mathbb N$, a set $X^k$ of subsets of $X^0$ (i.e. each $X^k$ is  a subset of the [power set](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/power_set) of $X^0$) such that each element of $X^k$ is a set with [cardinality](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/cardinal_number) $k+1$ and such that any subset of an element of $X^k$ of size $\ell + 1$ is an element of $X^\ell$.
