Let $G$ be a [group](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/group). A **normal series** is an ascending sequence of [subgroups](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/subgroup) $$\{e\} = N_0\subseteq N_1\subseteq \cdots\subseteq N_{k-1} \subseteq N_k = G$$ such that $N_i$ is [normal normal](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/normal_#########normal) in $G$ for all $0\leq i\leq k$.
