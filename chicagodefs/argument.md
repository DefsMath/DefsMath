Let $z\in \mathbb C$ be a [complex number](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/complex_numbers). Then the **argument** of $z$, denoted $\text{arg}(z)$, is the angle between the vector in $\mathbb R^2$ corresponding to $z$ and the positive real axis. Equivalently, it is any real number $\theta$ such that $z= r(\cos\theta+i\sin\theta) = re^{i\theta}$, via [Euler's formula](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/Euler's_formula).
