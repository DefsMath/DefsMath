Let $f$ be a [differentiable](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/differentiable) function in any sense. The **logarithmic derivative** of $f$ is $f'/f$. This follows from the [chain rule](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/chain_rule) as the derivative of the [logarithm](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/logarithm) of $f$.
