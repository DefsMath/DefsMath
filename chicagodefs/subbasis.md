---Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [topological space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/topological_space). A **subbasis** $S$ for the [topology](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/topological_space) $\tau$ is a subset of $\tau$ such that every  set in $\tau$ is a union of finite intersection of sets in $S$.
