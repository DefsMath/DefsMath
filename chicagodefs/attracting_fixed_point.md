---An **attracting fixed point** of a function $f$ is a point $x_0$ in the [domain](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/domain) of $f$ for which there exists a [neighborhood](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/neighborhood) $U$ of $x_0$ such that for all $x \in U$, the iterated function sequence $\{f^{\circ n}(x)\}_{n\in\mathbb n}$ [converges](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/sequence_convergence)to $x_0$.
