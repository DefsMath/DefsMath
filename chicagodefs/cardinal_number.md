Assuming the [Axiom of Choice](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/Axiom_of_Choice), the **cardinality** of a set $X$ is the least [ordinal number](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/ordinal_number) $\alpha$ such that there exists a [bijection](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/bijective) between $X$ and $\alpha$. 

There exists a [well-ordering](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/well-ordering) on the cardinal numbers under the relation $|A| \leq |B|$ if and only if there exists an [injection](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/injective) from $A$ to $B$.
