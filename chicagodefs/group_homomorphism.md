A **[group](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/group) homomorphism**is a function $f: G\to H$ between [groups](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/group) $G$ and $H$ is a function that preserves the group [operation](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/binary_operation); that is $f(gh)=f(g)f(g)$ for all $g,h \in G$. 

A **group [isomorphism](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/isomorphism)** is a homomorphism that is also [bijective](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/bijective).
