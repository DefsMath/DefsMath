A [representation](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/group_representation) of a [topological group](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/topological_group) $G$ (written $\rho:G\to GL(V)$ for $GL(V)$  the [general linear group](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/general_linear_group) of some [vector space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/vector_space) $V$) is called **continuous** if it is of finite [dimension of dimension](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/dimension_of_#####################dimension) and if $\rho$ is [continuous](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/continuous) in the usual sense as a function between [topological spaces](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/topological_space).
