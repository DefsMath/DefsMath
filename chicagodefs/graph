---A **graph** $X$ is a [topological space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/topological_space) obtained from a discrete set $X^0$ of points called **vertices** and a discrete set $J$ of functions $j:S^0\to X^0$ as the [quotient space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/quotient_of_topological_spaces) of the disjoint union $X^0/\coprod (J\times I)$ where $I$ is the unit [interval](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/interval) obtained by identifying $(j,0)$ with $j(0)$ and $(j,1)$ with $j(1)$. The images of the [intervals](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/interval) $j\times I$ are called **edges**.

A **graph** can also be though of as a 1-dimensional [CW complex](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/CW_complex) whose $0$-cells are the vertices and whose $1$-cells are the edges and where the endpoints of each edge are identified with the vertices attached to it.
