---The [σ-algebra](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/σ-algebra) **generated** by a collection of subsets is the [σ-algebra](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/σ-algebra) containing all of the subsets such that any [σ-algebra](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/σ-algebra) containing the sets also contains it.
