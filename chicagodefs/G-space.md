Let $G$ be a [group](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/group) and let $X$ be a [topological space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/topological_space). Then $X$ is a **$G$-space** if it is a [G-set](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/group_action) and the [group action](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/group_action) $G\times X\to X$ is [continuous](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/continuous). 

The **orbit space** $X/G$ is the set of [orbits](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/orbit) $\{Gx\mid x\in X\}$ with [topology](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/topological_space) given as the [quotient of topological spaces](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/quotient_of_topological_spaces).

Note that in the case of a discrete [group](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/group) $G$, the [continuity](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/continuous) condition means that each action by an element of $G$ is a [homeomorphism](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/homeomorphism).
