Let $S \subset\mathbb R^n$ be [rectifiable](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/rectifiable). $S$ is **symmetric** with respect to the [vector subspace](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/vector_subspace) $x_k=0$ if the function $h:S\to\mathbb R^n$ given by $$h(x) = h(x_1,\dots, -x_k, \dots, x_n)$$ has as its [image](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/image) $S$ itself.
