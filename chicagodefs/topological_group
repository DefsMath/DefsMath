---A **topological group** is a [topological space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/topological_space) $G$ that is also a [group](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/group) such that the [binary operation](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/binary_operation) on the [group](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/group) and the inverse map are both [continuous](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/continuous). That is, the two maps $$\cdot:G\times G\to G \text{ given by } (x,y)\mapsto xy$$$$\text{inv}:G\to G \text{ given by } x\mapsto x^{-1}$$ are both [continuous](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/continuous) where $G\times G$ is given the [product topology](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/product_topology).
