---A subset $H\subset G$ of the [group](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/group) $G$ is a **subgroup** of $G$ if it is itself a [group](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/group) under the [operation](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/binary_operation) inherited from $G$.

The **subgroup axioms** are
- closure under $*$;
- the [identity element](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/identity_element) of $G$ is in $H$;
- for every $h\in H$, the [inverse element](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/inverse_element) $h^{-1}$ is also in $H$.
