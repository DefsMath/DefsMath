 title: boundary points of a manifold
 permalink: /boundary_points_of_a_manifold
---Let $M$ be a [manifold with boundary](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/topological_m-dimensional_manifold_with_boundary). The **boundary points** of $M$ are the points $p\in M$ for which there exists a [chart](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/chart) $(U,\phi)$ such that $\phi(p) \in \partial H^m$, the [boundary of the closed half-space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/boundary_of_the_closed_half-space).
