 title: algebra of polynomial differential operators
 permalink: /algebra_of_polynomial_differential_operators
---Consider the [polynomial ring](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/polynomial_ring) $P_n =\mathbb C[x_1,\dots,x_n]$. Let $\partial_i = \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}$ be the [partial derivative](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/partial_derivative) with respect to the variable $x_i$. Note that it is a [linear transformation](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/linear_transformation) from $P_n$ to itself. Let $D_n$ be the [subalgebra](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/subalgebra) of the [algebra](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/algebra_of_linear_maps) of $\mathbb C$-[linear](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/linear_transformation) maps $P_n\to P_n$ [generated](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/generate_an_associative_algebra) by the $\partial_i$. Since [partial derivatives](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/partial_derivative) [commute](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/commute) with each other, the [algebra](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/algebra_over_a_field) $D_n$ is [commutative](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/commutative). Elements of $D_n$ take the form $$u = \sum_{k_1,\dots,k_n \geq 0} c_{k_1,\dots,k_n} \frac{\partial^{k_1+\cdots + k_n}}{\partial x_1^{k_1}\cdots \partial x_n^{k_n}}$$ for $c_{k_1,\dots,k_n}\in\mathbb C$. This is the **algebra of polynomial differential operators in $n$ variables with constant coefficients**.

The $\mathbb C$-span of the $\partial_i$ is a [vector subspace](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/vector_subspace) of $D_n$ given by the [directional derivatives](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/directional_derivative) along $v\in \mathbb C^n$
