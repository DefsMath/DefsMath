If $\sigma \in S_n$ is an element of the [symmetric group](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/symmetric_group) on $n$ letters, then it [is](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/cycle_decomposition) the product of disjoint [cycles](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/cycle) of length $n_1\leq\cdots\leq n_r$ (including the $1$-cycles!) and moreover the sum of the $n_i$ is equal to $n$. The [partition](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/partition_of_an_integer) of $n$ given by the $n_i$ is called the **cycle type** of $\sigma$.
